# üîê Enhanced Security Policy Document

## Intelligent Inventory Management DataOps Sandbox

This security policy document defines robust best practices, roles, responsibilities, and access management, incorporating advanced concepts such as **Declarative Policy Controls** and **Service Boundaries** to enhance security and compliance within the Intelligent Inventory Management sandbox environment involving Snowflake, DBT, GitHub Actions, and Slack integration.

## üìå **Scope**

Applies explicitly to:

* Snowflake resources (schemas, tables, roles)
* DBT transformations and deployments
* GitHub Actions workflows and security auditing
* Slack notifications and alerts

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Roles & Responsibilities**

| Role                   | Responsibility                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DataOps Engineers**  | DBT pipeline management, schema/object lifecycle, workflow automation     |
| **Security Admin**     | Manage Snowflake security policies, declarative controls, auditing        |
| **Developers**         | Adhere to security guidelines, code quality, declarative policy adherence |
| **Reviewers/Auditors** | Validate compliance with policies, oversee security and risk controls     |

---

## üîë **Access Control Policies**

Enforce strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** aligned with **least-privilege principles**:

* Each DBT environment has explicitly assigned schemas based on GitHub Issue IDs.
* Access granted using dynamic roles (`LOGISTICS_DBT_ROLE`) managed declaratively via IaC (Infrastructure as Code) practices.

**Example RBAC Enforcement in Snowflake:**

```sql
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS LOGISTICS_DBT_ROLE;

GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE LOGISTICS_DEMO TO ROLE LOGISTICS_DBT_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE LOGISTICS_DEMO TO ROLE LOGISTICS_DBT_ROLE;
GRANT ROLE LOGISTICS_DBT_ROLE TO USER LOGISTICS_DBT_USER;
```

---

## üìã **Declarative Policy Controls**

Declarative controls explicitly define **expected states** rather than procedural commands, reducing configuration drift and enhancing security posture clarity.

**Implementation Practices:**

* All Snowflake roles, permissions, and access policies declared via version-controlled code (IaC).
* GitHub Actions workflows explicitly define policies governing DBT deployments.
* Regular reconciliation of actual vs. declared policy state through automation.

**Benefits:**

* Increased predictability and auditability.
* Reduced manual intervention and associated risk.
* Rapid compliance validation through automation.

---

## üöß **Service Boundaries and Isolation**

Clearly define **Service Boundaries** to segment workloads, limiting lateral movement and reducing the blast radius of security incidents:

**Implementation Practices:**

* Each GitHub Issue-driven feature deployment explicitly creates isolated schemas and tables.
* Logical boundaries enforced at schema-level in Snowflake to isolate development, testing, and production workloads.
* Each schema has explicitly declared access controls, isolating resources between feature branches clearly.

**Benefits:**

* Enhanced security through isolation of workloads.
* Clear boundaries simplify compliance audits.
* Minimization of incident impact.

---

## üö® **Incident Response and Alerting**

Clearly structured incident management process:

* **Declarative Alerting**: GitHub Actions explicitly define alerts for incidents (pipeline failures, security issues, policy violations).
* **Real-Time Slack Alerts**: Immediate notification enabling rapid detection and response.
* **Structured Workflow**: Detection ‚Üí Notification ‚Üí Diagnosis ‚Üí Resolution ‚Üí Post-Incident Analysis.

---

## üîç **Security Auditing & Compliance**

Auditing is integrated directly into automation workflows:

* **Pre-commit Hooks**: Immediate feedback on code quality and secrets leakage.
* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated SQL linting (SQLFluff) explicitly enforcing secure coding standards.
* **Continuous Declarative Compliance**: GitHub Actions ensure continuous alignment between declared policy state and actual state.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Data Security & Protection**

* Sandbox explicitly avoids sensitive or personal data storage.
* Any sensitive data handled explicitly with anonymization or encryption.

---

## üìå **Developer Security Checklist**

‚úÖ Use pre-commit hooks explicitly for security scanning.
‚úÖ Ensure schema/object creation and deletion explicitly documented via GitHub issues.
‚úÖ Immediately address Slack alerts explicitly for incidents.
‚úÖ Adhere strictly to declarative policy states defined in IaC.
‚úÖ Continuously review DBT and Snowflake resources explicitly for compliance adherence.

---

## üìÜ **Security Policy Review Schedule**

Quarterly reviews or as required by significant changes:

| Review Date | Reviewer       | Outcome                          |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 2024-04-01  | Security Admin | Initial policy established       |
| 2024-07-01  | TBD            | Quarterly security policy review |

## ‚úÖ **Summary**

This enhanced Security Policy explicitly integrates advanced concepts such as **Declarative Policy Controls** and clearly defined **Service Boundaries**, significantly strengthening the sandbox's security posture and compliance adherence.

By following these clearly defined guidelines and practices, the Intelligent Inventory Management sandbox remains robust, secure, and fully aligned with modern DataOps and DataSecOps best practices.
